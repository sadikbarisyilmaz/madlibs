Wolves[n] asleep amidst the trees, Bats[n] all a swaying[v] in the breeze, But one soul[n] lies anxious[a] wide awake, Fearing[v] all manner of ghouls, hags and wraiths[n]. Birds are silent[a] for the night, Cows[n] turned in as daylight dies[v], But one soul lies[v] anxious wide awake. For the Witcher[n], brave and bold[a], Paid in coin of gold. Heâ€™ll chop and slice you, Cut[v] and dice[v] you. Eat you up whole. Eat you whole.
